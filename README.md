**General-Purpose Thought-Work Harness**

🎒 Portable harness without vendor lock-in.

Kit is a general-purpose harness for disciplined thought work.
Its deepest engine is a document-first, spec-driven workflow, but the harness
also supports ad hoc execution, catch-up, handoff, summarization, review, and
orchestration.

Today, the shipped command surface is packaged around repository and software
work. The underlying concepts are broader: they generalize to research,
strategy, operations, policy, writing, analysis, and other fields where you
need explicit constraints, structured exploration, planning, execution, and
reflection.

Harness principles:

- 🧰 harness-first, workflow-second
- 📄 documents are the source of truth
- 🧠 spec-driven planning is the strongest engine for ambiguous or high-risk work
- ⚡ ad hoc work stays lightweight but still verified
- 🤝 portable and agent-agnostic by default
- 🔍 explicit gates beat hidden automation
- 🔄 reflection closes the loop after code changes

### 🌍 Cross-Domain Concepts

The artifact model is broader than software:

| Kit Concept                                      | In Software                            | In Research                           | In Strategy / Ops                   | In Writing / Policy                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `CONSTITUTION.md`                                | engineering constraints                | study constraints                     | operating principles                | editorial or policy constraints         |
| `BRAINSTORM.md`                                  | codebase research                      | literature scan                       | landscape scan                      | source gathering and framing            |
| `SPEC.md`                                        | feature requirements                   | research question or hypothesis       | decision brief                      | argument or policy brief                |
| `PLAN.md`                                        | implementation plan                    | study design                          | rollout plan                        | outline and revision plan               |
| `TASKS.md`                                       | execution checklist                    | experiment tasks                      | workback schedule                   | drafting and review checklist           |
| `implement`                                      | coding and integration                 | running the study                     | executing the change                | drafting and editing                    |
| `reflect`                                        | verification and regression review     | results review                        | retro and validation                | revision review and critique            |
| `reconcile` / `resume` / `summarize` / `handoff` | reconcile, resume, or transfer context | reconcile or resume the investigation | reconcile or transfer project state | reconcile or transfer editorial context |

The names may be software-flavored today, but the structure is general:
constraints, research, specification, planning, execution, verification, and
transfer are common to most serious thought work.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
go install github.com/jamesonstone/kit/cmd/kit@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesonstone/kit.git
cd kit
make build
```

To enable the repository-managed Git hooks for this clone:

```bash
make install-git-hooks
```

This configures `core.hooksPath` to use `.githooks/`, including a `pre-commit`
hook that runs `make build` before every `git commit`. If the build fails, the
commit is blocked.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# initialize the project
# copies a CONSTITUTION.md drafting prompt to your clipboard
kit init

# paste the copied prompt into your coding agent to build docs/CONSTITUTION.md

# optionally capture research first
kit brainstorm my-feature

# for frontend-heavy work, opt into frontend-specific prompt guidance
kit brainstorm dashboard-redesign --profile=frontend

# capture out-of-scope follow-up work without changing the active lane
kit brainstorm --backlog shared-refactor

# review deferred backlog items
kit backlog

# write the spec
kit spec my-feature

# define the plan
kit plan my-feature

# break work into tasks
kit tasks my-feature

# start implementation
# runs the readiness gate, then outputs coding-agent context
kit implement my-feature

# inspect progress at any time
kit status

# inspect the full project overview
kit status --all

# reorient before resuming work
kit resume my-feature

# inspect the current document map and feature lineage
kit map

# pause a feature without losing its phase
kit pause my-feature

# mark all eligible active features complete
kit complete --all

# remove a feature and its lifecycle state
kit remove my-feature --yes
```

### 🔧 Utilities

| Command          | Description                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `kit upgrade`    | Download and install the latest Kit release |
| `kit version`    | Print the installed Kit version             |
| `kit completion` | Generate shell autocompletion script        |

Hidden compatibility commands remain callable for migration, but they are no longer shown in
default help or primary docs: `kit update`, `kit skills`, `kit catchup`, `kit scaffold`,
`kit rollup`, and `kit brainstorm --pickup`.

Prompt-producing commands default to subagent orchestration guidance. Pass
`--single-agent` when you explicitly want to keep the work in one lane.

Prompt-producing commands also support `--profile=frontend` for frontend-heavy
work. The profile keeps Kit's normal RLM flow, but adds frontend-specific
guidance for design-system fit, domain-appropriate UI, visual assets,
responsive behavior, browser or screenshot validation, interaction states, and
common generated-UI pitfalls. Feature-scoped commands can carry the profile
forward through the feature's dependency table once it has been recorded.

Use `kit dispatch` when you need the full overlap-clustering and queue-planning
workflow for a raw task set. Use the default prompt path when the agent should
use subagents opportunistically, and use `kit dispatch` when you want a formal
discovery report, overlap clustering, and explicit approval before launch.

### 📋 Output Behavior

Prompt-producing commands, including the constitution prompt emitted by
`kit init`, copy their generated output to the clipboard by default. Pass
`--output-only` to print the raw prompt or output to stdout instead, or combine
`--output-only --copy` to do both.

In interactive terminals, Kit also uses clearer section spacing and semantic
emoji markers for help, status, selectors, and other human-readable guidance.
Status views may also use ANSI color in a real terminal to highlight lifecycle
markers, state labels, file presence, and progress without changing non-TTY
output.
Raw `--output-only` payloads and `--json` output stay unchanged.

Lifecycle views surface paused work explicitly. `kit status` keeps the active
feature in focus, `kit status --all` provides the project overview as a
fixed-width lifecycle matrix, and
deferred brainstorm items stay available through `kit backlog`,
`kit backlog --pickup`, or `kit resume`.

### ♻️ Prompt Regeneration

Feature-scoped prompt commands also accept `--prompt-only` to regenerate the
selected feature's prompt without mutating repository docs:
`kit brainstorm`, `kit spec`, `kit plan`, `kit tasks`, `kit implement`,
`kit reflect`, `kit reconcile`, `kit handoff`, and `kit skill mine`. For
`brainstorm`, `spec`, `plan`, and `tasks`, `--prompt-only` skips scaffolding
and rollup writes, requires the existing artifact set, and uses the normal
existing-feature selector when no feature argument is provided.

### ⛏️ Skill Mining

| Command                    | Description                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kit skill mine [feature]` | Output skill extraction prompt for the active coding agent |

`kit scaffold-agents` also supports the singular alias `kit scaffold-agent`.

When instruction files already exist:

- default mode skips them and suggests safer next steps
- `--append-only` merges missing Kit-managed sections without overwriting matched existing content
- `--force` overwrites existing files after confirmation
- `--force --yes` overwrites existing files without prompting for automation use

Instruction scaffold versions:

- `--version 1` keeps the legacy verbose `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` model
- `--version 2` uses thin entrypoints plus `docs/agents/` and `docs/references/` for repo-local ToC and RLM routing
- new repos default to `v2`
- existing repos keep their current model unless `--version` explicitly switches them
- switching models is a repo-wide change and requires `--force`

## 🗂️ Structured Engine: Artifact Pipeline

The artifact pipeline is Kit's most structured operating engine. It is not the
entire product, but it is the clearest path when a problem needs deliberate
discovery, planning, and execution control in any domain.

### 🏗️ Project Initialization

Run once, then refine as the project matures:

```text
┌──────────────┐
│ Constitution │  ← global constraints, principles, priors
└──────────────┘
```

### 🧠 Optional Research Step

```text
┌──────────────┐
│ Brainstorm   │  ← codebase research, options, affected files
└──────────────┘
```

### 🔁 Core Development Loop

```text
┌──────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐    ┌──────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────┐
│ Brainstorm   │ ─▶ │ Specification │ ─▶ │ Plan │ ─▶ │ Tasks │ ─▶ │ Implementation │ ─▶ │ Reflection │ ─┐
└──────────────┘    └───────────────┘    └──────┘    └───────┘    └────────────────┘    └────────────┘  │
       ▲                                                                                                │

```

### 📝 Artifact Details

1. 📜 **Constitution** — strategy, patterns, long-term vision
2. 🧠 **Brainstorm** — optional research, findings, relationships, dependencies, strategy
3. 📐 **Specification** — what is being built, why, and how it relates to prior features
4. 🗺️ **Plan** — how it will be built
5. ✅ **Tasks** — executable work units
6. 🛠️ **Implementation** — execution after the readiness gate passes
7. 🔍 **Reflection** — verification and learning after implementation

Spec-driven prompts must populate every section in `BRAINSTORM.md`, `SPEC.md`,
`PLAN.md`, and `TASKS.md`. If a section has no additional detail, replace the
placeholder comment with `not applicable`, `not required`, or
`no additional information required`.

## 🧠 Brainstorm — Interactive Research Entry Point

`kit brainstorm` is now the optional front door for new feature work. It asks for:

1. the feature name using the same normalization rules as `kit spec`
2. a short user thesis describing the issue or feature

Then Kit:

- creates or reuses `docs/specs/<feature>/`
- creates `BRAINSTORM.md` as the first artifact in that directory
- requires the coding agent to keep the `## RELATIONSHIPS` section current with explicit prior-feature lineage or `none`
- requires the coding agent to keep the `## DEPENDENCIES` table current with the inputs used during the brainstorm phase
- opens a vim-compatible editor by default for the multiline thesis, with step instructions and a press-any-key launch gate
- supports `--inline` to use terminal multiline entry with `Shift+Enter` and `Ctrl+J`, including consecutive blank lines
- keeps `--vim` and `--editor=vim` as explicit editor controls, though vim-mode is already the default for multiline free-text responses
- outputs a planning-only prompt that starts with `/plan`
- tells the coding agent to research the codebase, use numbered lists, ask questions in batches of up to 10, and avoid implementation
- requires the agent to include recommended defaults, accept `yes` / `y` for whole-batch approval and `yes 3, 4, 5` / `y 3, 4, 5` for numbered approval, state uncertainties, output percentage-understanding progress after each batch, and continue until the spec is precise enough for a production-quality solution
- supports `--backlog` to capture a deferred brainstorm item without outputting a planning prompt
- keeps `--pickup` callable as a hidden compatibility path while teaching `kit resume <feature>` or `kit backlog --pickup <feature>` as the primary resume flows

### 💡 Why this matters

`BRAINSTORM.md` becomes the durable bridge between early ideation and the formal artifact pipeline. When present, downstream commands use it as research context while still treating `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `TASKS.md` as the binding execution contract.

### 🪜 Typical flow

```text
You / team idea
  ↓
kit brainstorm my-feature
  ↓
BRAINSTORM.md + planning-only /plan prompt
  ↓
kit spec my-feature
  ↓
kit plan my-feature
  ↓
kit tasks my-feature
  ↓
kit implement my-feature
  ↓
kit reflect my-feature
```

`kit implement` begins with an implementation readiness gate that adversarially
challenges `CONSTITUTION.md`, optional `BRAINSTORM.md`, `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`,
and `TASKS.md` before any code work starts. If the gate fails, update the
canonical docs first, then rerun the gate before implementing.

### ▶️ Usage

```bash
# interactive brainstorm for a new feature
kit brainstorm my-feature

# frontend-heavy brainstorm with design-material scaffolding
kit brainstorm dashboard-redesign --profile=frontend

# capture a deferred follow-up feature and leave it in backlog
kit brainstorm --backlog shared-refactor

# open or continue an existing brainstorm
kit brainstorm my-feature

# print the raw prompt to stdout instead of copying it
kit brainstorm my-feature --output-only

# regenerate the brainstorm prompt from an existing BRAINSTORM.md without touching repo docs
kit brainstorm my-feature --prompt-only

# opt out of default vim-mode and use inline multiline entry
kit brainstorm my-feature --inline

# write the generated /plan prompt to a file
kit brainstorm my-feature --output tmp/brainstorm-prompt.md

# list deferred backlog items
kit backlog

# resume a deferred backlog item
kit backlog --pickup shared-refactor

# canonical general resume flow
kit resume shared-refactor
```

`kit spec <feature> --interactive` now opens a vim-compatible editor for each
free-text answer by default. Use `kit spec <feature> --interactive --inline`
to opt back into terminal multiline entry.

### 📄 What goes in `BRAINSTORM.md`

- summary of the issue or opportunity
- user thesis in the user's own words
- explicit relationship to prior features or `none`
- codebase findings and relevant architecture notes
- affected files with concrete paths
- unresolved questions and viable options
- recommended strategy and the next workflow step

## ✨ Positioning

Kit is broader than a spec generator. It is a harness for disciplined
development workflows:

- structured planning when scope is unclear
- lightweight ad hoc execution when the change is contained
- recovery tools such as `reconcile`, `resume`, `summarize`, and `handoff`
- review and orchestration tools such as `code-review` and `dispatch`

Spec-driven development principles remain a core engine inside that harness,
not the only identity of the tool.

## ✨ Inspiration

Kit is inspired by GitHub's [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit),
which pioneered the concept of specification-driven development. Kit keeps that
discipline where it helps most, then broadens it into a lighter, more portable,
general-purpose harness.
