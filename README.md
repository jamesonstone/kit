                    repository memory for coding agents
```

Kit is a portable, agent-agnostic repository-memory harness for coding agents.
It keeps accepted plans, material decisions, discoveries, validation, and
outcomes in the repository when code and tests cannot preserve the important
why.

## Start Here

| Need | Go To |
| --- | --- |
| 🧭 Understand what Kit is | [docs/overview.md](docs/overview.md) |
| ⚙️ Install and use commands | [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md) |
| 🔁 Understand the memory workflow | [docs/workflows.md](docs/workflows.md) |
| 📚 Browse all documentation | [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) |
| 🧱 Read project invariants | [docs/CONSTITUTION.md](docs/CONSTITUTION.md) |
| 🤖 Read agent routing docs | [docs/agents/README.md](docs/agents/README.md) |

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/jamesonstone/kit/cmd/kit@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesonstone/kit.git
cd kit
make build
```

Enable repository-managed hooks for this clone:

```bash
make install-git-hooks
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# initialize Kit in a repository
kit init

# scaffold durable feature memory after native planning
kit spec my-feature

# inspect progress
kit status --all

# reorient before continuing
kit resume my-feature

# inspect command behavior before choosing a command
kit capabilities --search spec

# validate or repair project configuration
kit config check

# verify a configured AWS identity before AWS work
kit aws verify
```

The default feature workflow is:

```text
native agent plan → semantic memory decision → SPEC.md when required → implementation → validation → curated repository memory
```

`SPEC.md` is the durable home for material feature rationale. Project
invariants belong in `CONSTITUTION.md`, reusable practices in references or
rules, and domain knowledge in its existing canonical documentation. A
justified `not required` memory decision is valid when code and tests preserve
the complete durable truth.

## Common Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `kit init` | Initialize or refresh project scaffolding, including a project-owned Makefile starter |
| `kit spec <feature>` | Non-interactively scaffold, adopt, or orient a living specification |
| `kit spec <feature> --legacy-supervisor` | Temporarily run the deprecated V2 lifecycle supervisor |
| `kit loop workflow <feature>` | Deprecated V2 compatibility loop; V3 specs use native planning |
| `kit loop review` | Review changed code until local correctness converges |
| `kit pr fix` | Select or target a PR and prepare a review-feedback dispatch prompt |
| `kit status --all` | Show project-wide feature state |
| `kit map --all` | Show the project document map |
| `kit capabilities --search <term>` | Inspect command behavior and mutation boundaries |
| `kit config check` | Validate schema-versioned `.kit.yaml` and offer safe interactive repairs |
| `kit aws verify` | Verify the configured AWS profile, account, and ARN against `.kit.yaml` |
| `kit improve run --suite prompt-system` | Run deterministic prompt regression and size checks |
| `kit prompt list` | List reusable prompt-library entries |
| `kit legacy --help` | List v1 staged workflow commands retained for migration |

See [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md) for the full command guide.
