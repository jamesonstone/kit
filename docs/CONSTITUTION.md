# CONSTITUTION

Kit is a document-centered CLI for spec-driven development. This constitution defines the invariant rules, patterns, and vision that guide all decisions.

---

## PRINCIPLES

### 1. Documents Are the Source of Truth

- Specifications drive code. Code serves specifications.
- All decisions must be traceable to a document.
- If reality diverges from documentation, update documentation first, then code.
- The repository should be understandable by reading docs alone.

### 2. Portable and Agent-Agnostic

- No vendor lock-in to any coding agent (Claude, Copilot, Codex, etc.).
- Documents use only markdown and YAML — universally readable.
- Agent pointer files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) link to canonical docs but never duplicate content.
- Agents can be swapped with zero document changes.

### 3. Minimal Magic, Explicit State

- Prefer explicit over implicit behavior.
- No hidden databases, lock files, or external state.
- All state lives in the filesystem (markdown files + `.kit.yaml`).
- Commands fail fast with actionable error messages.

### 4. Opinionated Defaults, Configurable Escapes

- Sensible defaults work out of the box.
- Configuration overrides via `.kit.yaml` for team customization.
- CLI flags always override configuration.
- Escape hatches exist but aren't encouraged.

### 5. Tooling Should Disappear

- Kit's job is done once documents are complete and correct.
- Implementation happens outside Kit's scope.
- The CLI becomes unnecessary once understanding is achieved.
- Teams should reach clarity faster with fewer reworks.

### 6. Density Over Prose

- Documents prioritize brevity and precision.
- One sentence where possible.
- Bullet points over paragraphs.
- Code snippets only when unavoidable.

## CONSTRAINTS

### Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **Artifact Pipeline Order**
   - Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Reflection
   - Each artifact gates the next (unless `--force` or `allow_out_of_order: true`)
   - Breaking this order requires explicit intent

2. **Document Structure**
   - All canonical markdown files use FULL CAPITALIZATION (e.g., `CONSTITUTION.md`, `SPEC.md`)
   - Use snake_case for multi-word file names (e.g., `PROJECT_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`)
   - Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., `0001-feat-name`)
   - Feature directories use numeric prefix + slug format

3. **Section Requirements**
   - Each document type has required sections that must be present
   - `CONSTITUTION.md`: PRINCIPLES, CONSTRAINTS, NON-GOALS, DEFINITIONS
   - `SPEC.md`: PROBLEM, GOALS, NON-GOALS, USERS, REQUIREMENTS, ACCEPTANCE, EDGE-CASES, OPEN-QUESTIONS
   - `PLAN.md`: SUMMARY, APPROACH, COMPONENTS, DATA, INTERFACES, RISKS, TESTING
   - `TASKS.md`: TASKS (with table), DEPENDENCIES, NOTES

4. **Single Feature Per Directory**
   - Never mix features in one `docs/specs/<feature>/` directory
   - If work spans features, update each feature's docs separately
   - Feature directories are immutable once created

5. **Git Branch Naming**
   - Branch names match feature directory names exactly
   - Format: `{numeric}-{slug}` (e.g., `0001-feat-name`)
   - Created automatically on `kit spec` unless `--no-branch`

6. **No Implementation Details in Specs**
   - `SPEC.md` defines WHAT, not HOW
   - No code in specifications
   - No technology choices unless absolutely required

7. **Traceability**
   - Tasks link to plan items using `[PLAN-XX]` syntax
   - Plan items link to spec items using `[SPEC-XX]` syntax
   - Every claim in `PROJECT_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md` must map to a feature document

### Code Quality Constraints

1. **Go Best Practices**
   - Single binary with subcommands (Cobra CLI)
   - No global state beyond package-level constants
   - Error handling must be explicit (`%w` for wrapped errors)
   - Test coverage for critical paths

2. **Package Structure**
   - `cmd/kit/` — main entry point only
   - `pkg/cli/` — command implementations
   - `internal/` — private packages (config, document, feature, git, rollup, templates)
   - No circular dependencies

3. **Error Messages**
   - Must be actionable (suggest fixes)
   - Include context (file paths, feature names)
   - Fail fast — don't continue with partial state

---

## CHANGE CLASSIFICATION

All work falls into one of two tracks. Classify before acting.

### Spec-Driven (Formal)

Use when ANY of these apply:

- Initiated via `kit spec` or `kit oneshot`
- New feature or capability
- Substantial architectural or behavioral change
- Work that has existing spec docs in `docs/specs/<feature>/`
- Change affects multiple components or public interfaces

**Workflow**: Full artifact pipeline — SPEC.md → PLAN.md → TASKS.md → implement → reflect

### Ad Hoc (Lightweight)

Use when ALL of these apply:

- Not initiated via `kit spec` or `kit oneshot`
- Bug fix, security review, refactor, dependency update, config change, or small refinement
- Scope is contained and well-understood without formal specification

**Workflow**: Understand → implement → verify

**Documentation**: Update only practical docs (READMEs, inline docs, API docs). Do NOT create SPEC.md / PLAN.md / TASKS.md for ad hoc work.

### Ad Hoc with Existing Specs

If an ad hoc change touches code covered by existing spec docs in `docs/specs/<feature>/`:

- **Default to updating** the spec docs if the change alters behavior, requirements, or approach
- **Skip spec updates** only if the change is purely mechanical (formatting, typo fix, dependency bump)

### Classification Examples

| Change | Track | Why |
| ------ | ----- | --- |
| New CLI command | Spec-driven | New capability |
| Fix nil pointer in existing handler | Ad hoc | Bug fix, contained scope |
| Security review of auth flow | Ad hoc | Review, no new feature |
| Refactor package structure | Ad hoc or Spec-driven | Depends on scope |
| Add streaming support to export | Spec-driven | Substantial behavioral change |
| Update dependency version | Ad hoc | Mechanical change |
| Fix typo in error message | Ad hoc | Trivial, mechanical |

## NON-GOALS

Kit explicitly does NOT:

### Process & Execution

- ❌ Execute code or run tests
- ❌ Manage agents directly or maintain prompt registries
- ❌ Merge branches or manage PRs
- ❌ Enforce git policies beyond branch creation
- ❌ Replace CI/CD systems

### Data & State

- ❌ Maintain databases or external state
- ❌ Use lock files or semaphores
- ❌ Store credentials or secrets
- ❌ Track metrics or analytics

### Content & Format

- ❌ Invent new document formats
- ❌ Generate prose or content (only templates)
- ❌ Define understanding rubrics or scoring models
- ❌ Duplicate specifications in agent files

### Scope

- ❌ Manage multi-repository projects
- ❌ Handle deployment or infrastructure
- ❌ Provide a web interface or GUI
- ❌ Support non-markdown documentation

---

## DEFINITIONS

### Artifact Pipeline

The ordered sequence of documents that drive development:

1. **Constitution** — Project-wide constraints, principles, long-term vision. Kept updated with priors. Single per repository.

2. **Specification (SPEC.md)** — What is being built and why. Requirements, acceptance criteria, edge cases. No implementation details.

3. **Plan (PLAN.md)** — How it will be built. Strategy, components, interfaces, risks. Explains approach, not code.

4. **Tasks (TASKS.md)** — Atomic executable work units. Maps to plan items. Reflects real progress.

5. **Implementation** — Code execution. Outside Kit's core scope.

6. **Reflection** — Verify correctness, refine understanding. Loops back to specification if needed.

### Feature

A self-contained unit of work with its own directory under `docs/specs/`. Identified by:

- **Numeric prefix**: Auto-assigned sequential number (e.g., `0001`)
- **Slug**: Lowercase kebab-case name, max 5 words (e.g., `init-project`)
- **Directory**: Combined format (e.g., `0001-init-project`)

### Phase

The current state of a feature in the artifact pipeline:

- `spec` — Has SPEC.md only
- `plan` — Has SPEC.md and PLAN.md
- `tasks` — Has SPEC.md, PLAN.md, and TASKS.md
- `implement` — Beyond Kit's scope

### Understanding Percentage

A single integer (0–100) reported by the coding agent indicating:

- Completeness of requirements understanding
- Clarity of implementation approach
- Readiness to proceed to next phase

Kit does not define a scoring rubric — the agent determines the value.

### Agent Pointer File

A lightweight markdown file (e.g., `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) that:

- Links to canonical documents
- Defines workflow contract for that agent
- Contains minimal agent-specific constraints
- Never duplicates specifications

### Project Root

The directory containing `.kit.yaml`. All Kit commands traverse upward to find this file. Enables running commands from any subdirectory.

### Rollup

The process of scanning all features and generating `PROJECT_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md`:

- High-level briefing document
- Sufficient to onboard or fork the project
- Primary context input for any coding agent

## ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS

### Package Organization

```bash
kit/
├── cmd/kit/main.go          # Entry point (5 lines)
├── pkg/cli/                  # Public CLI commands
│   ├── root.go              # Root command, banner, colors
│   ├── init.go              # kit init
│   ├── spec.go              # kit spec <feature>
│   ├── plan.go              # kit plan <feature>
│   ├── tasks.go             # kit tasks <feature>
│   ├── check.go             # kit check [feature]
│   ├── rollup.go            # kit rollup
│   ├── handoff.go           # kit handoff [feature]
│   ├── summarize.go         # kit summarize [feature]
│   ├── reflect.go           # kit reflect [feature]
│   └── scaffold_agents.go   # kit scaffold-agents
├── internal/
│   ├── config/config.go     # .kit.yaml loading, project root discovery
│   ├── document/document.go # Markdown parsing, validation, section extraction
│   ├── feature/feature.go   # Feature numbering, slug validation, directory management
│   ├── git/git.go           # Branch creation, checkout, status
│   ├── rollup/rollup.go     # PROJECT_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md generation
│   └── templates/templates.go # Embedded document templates
└── docs/
    ├── CONSTITUTION.md      # This file
    ├── PROJECT_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md
    └── specs/               # Feature directories
```

### Command Pattern

Each command follows the same structure:

1. Find project root via `config.FindProjectRoot()`
2. Load configuration via `config.Load(projectRoot)`
3. Resolve feature via `feature.Resolve()` or `feature.EnsureExists()`
4. Perform action (create/validate documents)
5. Update rollup via `rollup.Update()`
6. Output next steps and agent prompts

### Error Handling Pattern

```go
// Wrap errors with context
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create %s: %w", path, err)
}

// Suggest fixes in error messages
return fmt.Errorf("SPEC.md not found. Run 'kit spec %s' first or use --force", slug)

// Use warnings for non-fatal issues
fmt.Printf("  ⚠ Could not update PROJECT_PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md: %v\n", err)
```

### Document Validation Pattern

```go
doc, err := document.ParseFile(path, document.TypeSpec)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
for _, e := range doc.Validate() {
    errors = append(errors, e.Error())
}
if doc.HasUnresolvedPlaceholders() {
    warnings = append(warnings, "has unresolved TODO placeholders")
}
```

## CODE STYLE CONVENTIONS

### Naming

- **Packages**: lowercase, single word (`config`, `document`, `feature`)
- **Files**: lowercase, descriptive (`config.go`, `document.go`)
- **Types**: PascalCase (`Config`, `Feature`, `Document`)
- **Functions**: PascalCase for exported, camelCase for internal
- **Variables**: camelCase (`projectRoot`, `specsDir`)
- **Constants**: PascalCase for exported, camelCase for internal

### Go Idioms

- Use `%w` for error wrapping
- Return errors, don't panic
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting
- Use `filepath.Join()` for paths
- Use `strings.Builder` for string concatenation

### CLI Conventions

- Use emoji sparingly for visual feedback (🎒 📁 ✓ ⚠ ❌ ✅ 📋 📝 🔎 📊 🔍)
- Provide copy-pasteable prompts for coding agents
- Show next steps after every command
- Support `--help` on all commands

---

## DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency               | Purpose                    | Version |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------- |
| `github.com/spf13/cobra` | CLI framework              | v1.10.2 |
| `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`       | YAML parsing for .kit.yaml | v3.0.1  |

### Why These Dependencies?

- **Cobra**: Industry standard for Go CLIs. Provides subcommands, flags, help generation.
- **YAML v3**: Required for `.kit.yaml` configuration. v3 has better error messages.

### No Additional Dependencies

Kit intentionally keeps dependencies minimal:

- No database drivers
- No HTTP clients
- No external services
- No testing frameworks beyond stdlib

---

## CONFIGURATION REFERENCE

### `.kit.yaml` Full Schema

```yaml
# Understanding threshold percentage (0-100)
goal_percentage: 95

# Location of feature specs relative to project root
specs_dir: docs/specs

# Location of constitution file
constitution_path: docs/CONSTITUTION.md

# If true, kit plan/tasks create missing prerequisites
allow_out_of_order: false

# Agent pointer files to scaffold on kit init
agents:
  - AGENTS.md
  - CLAUDE.md

# Git branching behavior
branching:
  enabled: true
  base_branch: main
  name_template: '{numeric}-{slug}'

# Feature directory naming
feature_naming:
  numeric_width: 4 # Pads to 0001, 0002, etc.
  separator: '-' # Between number and slug
```

---

## LONG-TERM VISION

### Kit 1.0 (Current)

- ✅ Document-centered workflow
- ✅ Feature lifecycle management
- ✅ Agent portability via pointer files
- ✅ Validation and rollup generation
- ✅ Context handoff between agents

### Kit 1.x (Near-term)

- [ ] Template customization via `.kit/templates/`
- [ ] Plugin system for custom validators
- [ ] Multi-language support for agent prompts
- [ ] Integration with common editors (VS Code, Neovim)

### Kit 2.0 (Future)

- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Specification diffing and versioning
- [ ] AI-assisted spec completion (opt-in)
- [ ] Metrics and insights (local only, no telemetry)

### Guiding Principle

Kit will always prioritize:

1. Documents over tools
2. Simplicity over features
3. Portability over convenience
4. Explicit over magic

The CLI should become unnecessary once understanding is achieved.

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Kit is successful if:

1. **Documents remain readable without Kit** — Any markdown viewer works
2. **Agents can be swapped with zero document changes** — No lock-in
3. **Teams reach clarity faster with fewer reworks** — Measurable improvement
4. **The CLI becomes unnecessary once understanding is achieved** — Tool disappears

---

## MAINTENANCE

This constitution should be updated when:

- Core principles change (rare)
- New patterns emerge from usage
- Constraints prove too restrictive or too loose
- Definitions need clarification
